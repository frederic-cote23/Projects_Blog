<h1>
Process Management
</h1>

A process is a program that's executing, like a browser.
A program is an application we can run, lile chrome.

There can be a many processes of the same program running at the same time.

All processes are running in sequence. However, the <b>Process Manager</b> is controlling the execution order to make thing smooth.

When a program wants to run, a process needs to be created for it.

A  <b>Time Slice</b> is a very short interval of time that gets allocated to a process for CPU execution.

The kernel creates processes, efficiently schedules them, and manages how processes are terminated
