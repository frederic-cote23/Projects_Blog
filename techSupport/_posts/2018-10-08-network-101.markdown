<h1>
Addresses
</h1>

A Mac Adress is physical addres. -> It's like the reveiver address
An IP Address is the address on a network, like the Internet. ->Â It's like a sender address

To connect to a server, you need both.

A <b> Packets </b> is the smallest bit of data that can be sent accross the Internet. 
Everything sent on the Internet is inside a Packets.

<h1>
Networking Gears
</h1>

Computer -> Router


<b>Router: </b> Connects lots of different devices together and help routing traffic. It knows where to send packets WITHIN a Network. 
Routers are like sending a mail to a buidling.

A <b> Switch </b> is like the mail delivery room WITHIN a buidling.



<h1>
Networking Protocol
</h1>

These are the set of rules that allows the networking gear to move Packets around.

It's HOW we transfert the data accross the network.

The rols of Network Protocol:
<ol>
  <li>Routed Efficiently</li>
  <li>Aren't corrupted</li>
  <li>Secured</li>
  <li>Right Machine</li>
  <li>Name Appropriately</li>
</ol>

IP:  Delivers packets to the right computer.

TCP: Delivers information from one network to another.

DNS: It's like a directory that tracks the Domain Name and IP address form all the Internet.
