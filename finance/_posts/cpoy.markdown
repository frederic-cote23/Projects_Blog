In simple terms, IV is determined by the current price of option contracts on a particular stock or future. It is represented as a percentage that indicates the annualized expected one standard deviation range for the stock based on the option prices. For example, an IV of 25% on a $200 stock would represent a one standard deviation range of $50 over the next year.

 One standard deviation is a measurement that encompasses approximately 68.2% of outcomes.

 When it comes to IV, one standard deviation means that there is approximately a 68% probability of a stock settling within the expected range as determined by option prices.

 In the example of a $200 stock with an IV of 25%, it would mean that there is an implied 68% probability that the stock is between $150 and $250 in one year.

<h2>Why is this important?</h2>

Options are insurance contracts, <b> and when the future of an asset becomes more uncertain, there is more demand for insurance on that asset</b>. 

When applied to stocks, this means that a stock’s options will become more expensive as market participants become more uncertain about that stock’s performance in the future. 

 <b>“IV expansion / Increase”</b>: When the uncertainty related to a stock increases and the option prices are traded to higher prices
